     * Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * <p>
     * Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] and k = 3
     * Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
     * Explanation:
     * rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
     * rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
     * rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
     * Example 2:
     * <p>
     * Input: [-1,-100,3,99] and k = 2
     * Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
     * Explanation:
     * rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
     * rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
     * Note:
     * <p>
     * Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
     * Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
