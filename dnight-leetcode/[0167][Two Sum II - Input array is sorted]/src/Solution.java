     * Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order,
     * find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
     * <p>
     * The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target,
     * where index1 must be less than index2.
     * <p>
     * Note:
     * <p>
     * Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
     * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.
     * Example:
     * <p>
     * Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
     * Output: [1,2]
     * Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
